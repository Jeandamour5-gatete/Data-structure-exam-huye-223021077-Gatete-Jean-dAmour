EXAMPLE1 DESCRIPTION
  #include <iostream>: This line tells the program to include the iostream library, which allows for input and output operations, like printing to the screen.
  using namespace std;: This line lets us use standard library features (like cout) without needing to prefix them with std::.
  int main() {: This is the main function where the program starts running.
  cout << "Hello, World!";: This prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
  return 0;: This ends the main function and returns 0 to indicate that the program ran successfully.
  }: This closes the main function.

 using namespace std;: This line lets us use standard library features (like cout) without needing to prefix them with std::.
 int main() {: This is the main function where the program starts running.
 int age = 20;: This creates an integer variable called age and sets its value to 20.
 double price = 19.99;: This creates a double variable called price and sets its value to 19.99.
char grade = 'A';: This creates a character variable called grade and sets its value to 'A'.
  string name = "Alice";: This creates a string variable called name and sets its value to "Alice".
  cout << "Name: " << name << endl;: This prints "Name: " followed by the value of name and then a new line.
  cout << "Age: " << age << endl;: This prints "Age: " followed by the value of age and then a new line.
  cout << "Price: $" << price << endl;: This prints "Price: $" followed by the value of price and then a new line.
  cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;: This prints "Grade: " followed by the value of grade and then a new line.
  return 0;: This ends the main function and returns 0 to indicate that the program ran successfully.
  }: This closes the main function.

  using namespace std;: This line lets us use standard library features (like cout) without needing to prefix them with std::.
  int main() {: This is the main function where the program starts running.
  string name;: This creates a string variable called name to store the user's name.
  int age;: This creates an integer variable called age to store the user's age.
  cout << "Enter your name: ";: This prints "Enter your name: " to the screen.
  cin >> name;: This waits for the user to input their name and stores it in the name variable.
  cout << "Enter your age: ";: This prints "Enter your age: " to the screen.
  cin >> age;: This waits for the user to input their age and stores it in the age variable.
  cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;: This prints a greeting message with the user's name and age, followed by a new line.
  return 0;: This ends the main function and returns 0 to indicate that the program ran successfully.
  }: This closes the main function.

  using namespace std;: This line lets us use standard library features (like cout) without needing to prefix them with std::.
  int main() {: This is the main function where the program starts running.
  int a = 10, b = 3;: This creates two integer variables called a and b and sets their values to 10 and 3, respectively.
  cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;: This prints "Sum: " followed by the result of a + b (which is 13) and then a new line.
  cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;: This prints "Difference: " followed by the result of a - b (which is 7) and then a new line.
  cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;: This prints "Product: " followed by the result of a * b (which is 30) and then a new line.
  cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl;: This prints "Quotient: " followed by the result of a / b (which is 3) and then a new line.
  cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl;: This prints "Remainder: " followed by the result of a % b (which is 1) and then a new line.
  return 0;: This ends the main function and returns 0 to indicate that the program ran successfully.
  }: This closes the main function.
